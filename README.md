# Sourcemod Plugins

A repo with the source for all my SourceMod plugins. To be honest, this is pretty much just for organization.

-   Exec On Empty ([AlliedMods](https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?t=325949)): A very simple plugin that executes a specified config whenever everyone on a server leaves.
-   Little Anti-Cheat - Auto SourceTV Recorder ([AlliedMods](https://forums.alliedmods.net/showpost.php?p=2709181&postcount=8)): Not my plugin, but I added a convar so that you can specify what directory the demos should go in.
